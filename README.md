# Chord_Progression_Generator

Hey!
This jupyter notebook opens the CSV file I created (available in my github repositories) from the McGill Billboard data, calculates the ratios between different chords, and uses these ratios to generate (4-chord-long) chord progressions. I plan on improving this project sometime in the near future, but for now, I'm pretty happy with how it turned it out. If you have any questions, or wish to use anything I've made, don't hesitate to reach out (cjf8329@nyu.edu). Thanks!
